# Project_SQL

This project involves exploring and cleaning data, creating databases, and writing sample queries using SQL. The project was completed using SQL, MySQL Workbench, Pandas, and SQL Alchemy.

## Overview

The project involved preparing five tables in Pandas: `film`, `actor`, `actor_has_film`, `category`, `inventory`, and `language`. After cleaning and transforming the data, a diagram was created in SQL Workbench that was used to generate a schema and dependencies. The data was then inserted into the database using Pandas and SQL Alchemy's `to_sql` method. Finally, a set of sample queries were created to ensure that the database was functioning correctly.

## Tools Used

- SQL
- MySQL Workbench
- Pandas
- SQL Alchemy

## Steps Taken

1. Preparing Data

   The first step involved preparing the data. The data was cleaned and transformed using Pandas, and then stored in dataframes.

2. Creating the Database

   A diagram was created in SQL Workbench that illustrated the schema and dependencies of the database. The schema and dependencies were then used to create the database.

3. Inserting Data

   The data from the dataframes was then inserted into the database using Pandas and SQL Alchemy's `to_sql` method.

4. Creating Sample Queries

   Finally, a set of sample queries were created to test the database and ensure that it was functioning correctly.

## Conclusion

This project involved preparing data, creating a database, inserting data into the database, and writing sample queries to test the database. The project was completed using SQL, MySQL Workbench, Pandas, and SQL Alchemy.
